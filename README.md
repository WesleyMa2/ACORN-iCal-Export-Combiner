# ACORN-iCal-Export-Combiner
## About
This is an online tool meant for students to easily merge different course schedules into one. The idea is to create a way for students to - at a glance - see which of their friends are in their lecture/tutorial.

After uploading multiple schedules for various students, the tool generates a *single* .ics file for a chosen student.
This file is a copy of the selected student's schedule, however their events will now contain a list of all other students who share this event.
